Will gold rise to $10,000?
SAN FRANCISCO â€“ It has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold.
Recently, however, this has become more difficult than ever, as the price of gold has risen by over 300 percent in the last decade.
Just last December, my colleagues Martin Feldstein and Nouriel Roubini wrote comments in which they boldly questioned the prevailing optimistic market sentiment and very thoughtfully pointed out the risks of gold.
And it came as it had to come.
Since her articles were published, the price of gold has risen even further.
It recently even reached a record high of $1,300.
Last December, gold bugs argued that the price would undoubtedly head towards $2,000.
Buoyed by the ongoing upward trend, some people now believe that gold could rise even higher.
A successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices had languished for over a decade before the Dow Jones index topped 1,000 in the early 1980s.
